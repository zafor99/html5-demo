00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,821
GOZPEL 1:1 FACEDOWN AT 15 BY YOUNG & WILD

3
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,107
MOTHER CALLING

4
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:03,694
It's the usual problem of limits.

5
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:08,656
When was the first time you got yourself off?

6
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:10,493
The first successful autoerotic stimulation

7
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,307
that put an end to frustrated fingering.

8
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,687
An attempt at meaningful finger-play.

9
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,582
At age ten, after getting home from school,

10
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:23,600
I would think about a classmate
who annoyed the fuck out of me:

11
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,085
CristiÃ¡n. Asshole.

12
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,456
He'd chase me around the school telling
me, "You're hot."

13
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:31,058
And I'd throw rocks at him.

14
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:33,124
He'd buy me candy bars,

15
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,421
and I'd throw rocks at him.

16
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,863
He'd try to be nice to me;

17
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:37,103
I'd throw a rock.

18
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,899
But once I got home,

19
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,347
I'd try to get my rocks off

20
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,853
instead of throwing them at him.

21
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:45,531
Try to, because I had no idea
what to do with my fiery twat.

22
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,963
Temporal ellipsis to age 15.

23
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,124
From 10 to 14, a series of flimsy fingers.

24
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,170
I even tried shoving a flashlight up there once-

25
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,966
a little red one.

26
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:58,144
Just like that.

27
00:03:58,188 --> 00:03:59,464
At age 15,

28
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,765
facedown with a finger and
rubbing up against the bed.

29
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,231
I couldn't believe it.

30
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:06,390
It was as easy as rubbing up against a bed.

31
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,290
At 16, the Cheese-Dick Man.

32
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,446
No fingers that year.

33
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,932
Virginity is lost in stages,

34
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:17,697
and it's got to be hard to lose it all at once.

35
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,740
<i>C</i> told me that after getting fucked up the ass,

36
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,297
diarrhea all day long.

37
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,129
She said, "The most painful
experience after childbirth."

38
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,878
I say, "Whatever."

39
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:31,529
With a lot of booze and beer in
me, it ain't bad.

40
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:34,033
I don't know how I ended
up ass up on the mattress.

41
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:36,012
I told him, "Dude, wrong hole."

42
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,941
Wrong hole.

43
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,159
But he put it in anyway.

44
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,017
So I said it again, "Wrong hole."

45
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,506
Wrong hole.

46
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:47,712
You're expected to put up some kind of struggle,

47
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:49,758
and I do what is expected of me.

48
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:53,407
Fuck it.

49
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:56,713
He stuck it up my ass for a while.
Neither good nor bad, just nothing...

50
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,941
like most of my losses.

51
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,415
Did I feel like taking a shit?
Yes.

52
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:04,080
But the suppositories from
when I was a kid hurt more.

53
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,675
It wasn't a total loss.

54
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:07,402
He didn't cum in my ass.

55
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,650
I'm still waiting for the right guy.

56
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:17,374
I'm an orthodox,
and I lose what people often lose.

57
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:20,256
A trinity of losses, feminine and heterosexual:

58
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,004
pussy, giving head, up the ass.

59
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:50,515
There are several types of people in the world.

60
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:54,014
There are those who don't believe in God.

61
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:57,313
Those who don't believe are increasing every day

62
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,891
due to the fact we've had two
agnostic, atheist presidents

63
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:03,557
who don't believe in God.

64
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,455
The world of an agnostic is a world

65
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:08,106
that begins and ends in his own mind.

66
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:11,013
He's the top authority in his life,

67
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,267
the captain of his own soul.

68
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,316
He is his own God!

69
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:16,570
"I don't believe in God.

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,979
"There's no superior being.

71
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,782
Therefore, I command myself."

72
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:25,949
This is why he lives a life of relative values,

73
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,319
relative to his person.

74
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:31,914
But God, my dear brothers and sisters...

75
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:32,961
Hey.

76
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,305
Is not relative.

77
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:36,846
He does not accept relativity.

78
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,363
God is living fire!

79
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,371
Amen!

80
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,473
God doesn't want lukewarm hearts.

81
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,130
Repeat with me:

82
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:47,928
I don't want to have a lukewarm heart.

83
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,118
I don't want to have a lukewarm heart.

84
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:52,891
God wants his fire

85
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:56,093
to penetrate each one of your hearts.

86
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:57,463
He is calling you.

87
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:58,500
Amen!

88
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,622
Listen to me well:

89
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,658
He is calling you!

90
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,434
Oh, yeah, and I'm the Evangelical one.

91
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,957
I'm from the sect of rich Evangeloons,
who are worse than the others,

92
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:08,559
'cause on top of everything else,

93
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:11,345
they think they're the shit
because they've got money.

94
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,459
I'm studying for my college placement test.

95
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,158
It is thus inferred that I'm really busy

96
00:07:15,188 --> 00:07:18,154
and I have no time to write this blog.

97
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,214
With fire!

98
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,680
Today

99
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:31,514
I shall rise

100
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:32,602
Get up.

101
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:37,254
And I will smile

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,591
Being with you

103
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,829
Raise your hands, you fool.

104
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:47,019
You

105
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,027
Teach me to believe

106
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,828
Fool, fool, fool.

107
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,931
But I still write.

108
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:57,016
That's why I pray to Jesus:

109
00:07:57,054 --> 00:08:01,019
Please make my mother never
type youngandwild.blogspot.com.

110
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:02,469
Make it so, please,

111
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,438
so that she never ever has.

112
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:09,026
YOUNG & WILD BY MARIALY RIVAS

113
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:12,185
Hey, I was hard-core Catholic,
virgin till marriage and stuff,

114
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:15,537
until I met a big ol' dick, and that was that.

115
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,148
Hey, Danilca!

116
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:18,873
Do you remember that song that said

117
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,161
Satan is like a lion?

118
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,717
Remember we had to roar?

119
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,955
PS. I also pray to Jesus

120
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:27,807
that your parents won't find your blog.

121
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:30,498
I ask him all day, all night, all afternoon,

122
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,036
all day, all night, all afternoon,

123
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,130
all morning, nonstop.

124
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:37,384
I want to be your mommy and
for you to be the daddy.

125
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:41,223
Barbage, the tigress of the west.

126
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,225
You know how sometimes when you're going at it

127
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:45,488
and the guy's dick slides out

128
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,399
and makes its way into the back door?

129
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:50,030
Hey, this is filthy.

130
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,921
My mommy told me that hope
is the last thing you lose,

131
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:54,861
so I'll leave you my MSN:

132
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:57,208
palitroke@gmail.com.

133
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:58,687
And I'd leave you my cell phone number,

134
00:08:58,717 --> 00:09:01,299
my ID number, and my home phone number,

135
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,595
but my mommy also told me

136
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,499
that there are a lot of bad people
out there in the world.

137
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,258
I'm not leaving my MSN,

138
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:09,097
but you can leave yours on my blog.

139
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:10,308
Ha.

140
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,474
Are they here?

141
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:21,835
Yes. Come down.

142
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,695
They're here. Come down.

143
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:28,882
But, Mom, I have to study.

144
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:29,958
Let's go.

145
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:43,156
GOZPEL 1:2 IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED
ALL MY HARDSHIPS (MOTHER AND FATHER)

146
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:46,277
One minute.

147
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,945
SimÃ³n, I got this for you.

148
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,836
It's Tim LaHaye's latest book.

149
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,912
No!

150
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,311
How wonderful.

151
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,830
Thank you very much, Rai.

152
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:09,981
Thank you.

153
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:12,066
For these 15 years of ministry.

154
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,120
Thank you.

155
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:17,742
Could you read a bit to us?
- No, no. - Yes.

156
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:18,928
No, you're the head of-

157
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,721
No, we're in your house. You read it.

158
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:21,807
Read it, come on.

159
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:29,548
"The term 'rapture is an expression that comes

160
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:33,721
"from the Greek word 'rapio,
' which means disappearance.

161
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:35,713
"Shortly before the end of the world,

162
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:39,012
Christ shall return in the air
and shall take with him..."

163
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,741
Father believes in Rapture.

164
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,279
Mother believes in Rapture.

165
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,479
Uncle believes in Rapture.

166
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,732
They believe that Jesus was telling the truth

167
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:48,493
when he said, "I'll be back soon."

168
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,793
And I want to not believe
because believing frightens me.

169
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:54,644
It won't be long before
the Lord's Second Coming.

170
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:58,002
It's all Uncle's fault.
I think that our generation

171
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:02,347
shall see Christ come to
take his Church with him.

172
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,507
I believe, SimÃ³n,

173
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,342
that all the signals have been given.

174
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:08,569
My pastor uncle comes over one night.

175
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,094
He sits at our dining room table,

176
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,934
says something I don't understand,

177
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,721
and points to the backyard.

178
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:25,130
In the dark backyard, there's a grotto.

179
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,502
In the grotto, a Virgin.

180
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:29,229
He picks up an axe,

181
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,620
walks over to the Virgin,
white and made of plaster...

182
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,111
And swings at it.

183
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,297
"Thou shalt not praise other images before me,"

184
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:41,631
says the pastor uncle that God says.

185
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,103
Postscript.

186
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:50,373
(Is that how you write "postscript"?)

187
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:51,790
I remember an axe,

188
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,238
but it probably was just
a crappy-ass bread knife.

189
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:02,541
But, hey, is the Virgin Satanic?

190
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,866
I still have a question.

191
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,917
Is the person writing this
blog a man or a woman?

192
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:07,518
She's a young lady. I can vouch.

193
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:08,825
Good blog.

194
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,453
Free Young!

195
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,109
Barbage, the tigress of the west.

196
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:17,113
I know you're hot. I know you're hot.

197
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:19,594
I don't care about the
Virgin or the fucking grotto.

198
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:21,218
I know you're hot.

199
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:22,266
She's not hot.

200
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:24,350
I know someone who knows her.

201
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:25,511
Bitch.

202
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:35,664
GOZPEL 1:3 WE ARE THE LIGHT
OF THE WORLD BY YOUNG & WILD

203
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:37,814
Morning, sir.

204
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:39,924
I need to talk to Daniela.

205
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:42,910
Daniela?

206
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,326
Could you come with me?

207
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:48,158
Now?

208
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:58,242
Do you know what a classmate of yours told me?

209
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,454
That you've had sex.

210
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,816
Sex before marriage.

211
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:20,103
You tempted a young boy-

212
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:24,099
not only in age but also in faith.

213
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,106
What a shame to look at you.

214
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,913
What sadness, Daniela.

215
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:34,899
What dishonor to your
parents, who love the Lord,

216
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:38,100
to have a daughter like you,

217
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:40,306
don't you think?

218
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:43,519
You can't carry on soiling
the sanctity of this school.

219
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,911
But there's less than a month left

220
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,716
for the college placement test.

221
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,587
It's over, Daniela.

222
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,758
You can't come back to this school.

223
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,036
We won't tolerate you any longer.

224
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,666
I got kicked out of school.

225
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,743
May her health be to your glory.

226
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,199
Let's go to the hospital.

227
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:11,321
Her fever is too high.

228
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:12,666
Hallelujah Lord.

229
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:15,220
Glorify yourself in her.

230
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:19,099
Lord, give us your peace in
order to accept your will.

231
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:23,099
In the name of Jesus, Lord, we bless you.

232
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,183
Careful, careful.

233
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:29,733
Lord, give us your peace to accept your will.

234
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:30,957
In the name of Jesus.

235
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:33,156
Lord, we bless you.

236
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:41,583
You're not going out for a year.

237
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,376
You won't see anyone either.

238
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,696
Not even PÃ­a.

239
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,646
You're not even going out
to the corner to buy bread.

240
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:57,562
No internet either.

241
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:04,046
And tomorrow, I'm signing you up

242
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,840
for We Are the Light of the World.

243
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,983
You hear me?

244
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:09,135
Oh, shit.

245
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,061
We Are the Light of the World? Shit.

246
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,655
A ship that sails out of Ecuador
and stops at a million ugly cities,

247
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:15,546
the kind where Evangelicals are eaten alive,

248
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,468
where they throw stones at Evangelicals,

249
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,550
and the Evangelics' eyes are shiny and bright

250
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,836
with missionary emotion, with martyrdom.

251
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,487
<i>But, Mom,</i>

252
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,615
I'm almost 18.

253
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:28,903
You can't do that to me.

254
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:30,008
Shut up.

255
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,291
Hey.

256
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,086
I'm not dead yet.

257
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:39,114
Danielita?

258
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:42,608
Could you ask your father
to call the pastor, hmm?

259
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,069
I don't think that it's a good idea.

260
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,319
And I'm not only saying it for her.

261
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,046
I'm also saying it for you.

262
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,308
Do you want her to get
closer to the Lord or not?

263
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,171
She's not going to do it like this.

264
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,204
Why don't you try to get her to finish school?

265
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,356
No.

266
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:24,753
I don't want her to go on that trip.

267
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:33,066
GOZPEL 1:4 LAKE OF FIRE BY YOUNG & WILD

268
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:37,339
Where milk and honey flow...

269
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:44,077
They walk and walk and walk,
and they never get there.

270
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:47,241
Poor, poor Moses,

271
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:50,287
because when they're about to arrive,

272
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:52,658
all of them feeling very thirsty,

273
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,731
God tells him...

274
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:57,463
Mother, they could have kicked me out of school

275
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,307
for setting a classroom on fire,
for poisoning a classmate,

276
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:02,967
for killing a teacher,

277
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,119
and you would have cared less
than expulsion for fornication.

278
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:08,681
Because your main commandment
is not "thou shalt not kill"

279
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:11,443
or "thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"
or blah, blah, blah;

280
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,449
your main commandment is
"thou shalt not fornicate."

281
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:17,654
And I, fornicator,

282
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,429
l am sent to the Evangeloon TV Station

283
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,052
where no one fornicates.

284
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:27,694
A life of partying...

285
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:30,652
I went out at night,

286
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:34,984
and I would look at myself in the mirror,

287
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:36,592
and each time I went out,

288
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:39,000
I would look at myself in the mirror.

289
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,891
And I would say to myself-

290
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:44,118
I would say, "Yes, I'm pretty."

291
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:49,014
But I felt that I was missing something.

292
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,572
I wasn't happy.

293
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,011
And that something...

294
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:55,484
was Jesus Christ.

295
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:59,149
How did you meet the Lord, ma'am?

296
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,706
It was really crazy.

297
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:05,962
I was walking down Providencia.
I love Providencia.

298
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:08,854
And suddenly, I sat down.

299
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:12,985
I collapsed on one of the
benches in Providencia,

300
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,666
and I said, "I can't take it anymore."

301
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,017
And a man tells me-

302
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:23,423
he approaches me and touches my shoulder-

303
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,438
"God loves you."

304
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:26,649
That simple.

305
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:30,411
And I was frozen.

306
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:33,986
And I said, "God loves me!"

307
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:37,036
A person he hasn't seen, that he doesn't know.

308
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:39,318
God loves me.

309
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,940
But, Mother, you may punish me,

310
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:43,546
but I can do whatever I want

311
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,276
in the name of my dirty poonani.

312
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,359
I can do anything in the name of the man of God

313
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:49,213
who I can't stop looking at.

314
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:51,459
Mother, I'm going to write you a poem

315
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,111
that rhymes and everything.

316
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,168
I'll take what's in store.
Your punishment I'll endure.

317
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,838
As for this man of God, I'll be his whore.

318
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,155
Hello.

319
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,318
Let's go.

320
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:27,543
Were those your work colleagues?

321
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:29,663
Do you work with them?

322
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,124
No, I'm the gofer.

323
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:38,110
You were there all day, I suppose.

324
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,775
Look, I'm asking just one thing from you.

325
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:45,978
Don't do anything at the TV station
that could embarrass me, okay?

326
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:47,381
Oh, Mom.

327
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,377
What did you have to do?

328
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,655
Coding.

329
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,477
Coding. That's nice.

330
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:07,983
What is it?

331
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,579
Something boring.

332
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,197
What are you thinking about?

333
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:30,183
Of what I would answer when you asked

334
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:32,123
what was I thinking about.

335
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,611
Well, I try to talk to you. l try.

336
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:38,601
And you: nothing.

337
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:40,068
Quiet. Always quiet.

338
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,534
Don't you want us to get closer?

339
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:52,424
I don't know.

340
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,808
The mechanism was as follows:

341
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:32,862
I would leave, hidden among my panties,

342
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,899
the love letters,

343
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:36,699
my extremely private journal,

344
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:39,429
go to school, come back, and Mother would say,

345
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,301
"By chance I found..."

346
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:47,199
Or, "I was cleaning, and I found..."

347
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:50,411
Or, "I found this on the floor..."

348
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:52,082
And what she had found was always

349
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:55,797
the journal or the love letters
that were filled with drawings of cocks

350
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:59,320
because of this boyfriend I had who didn't know
how to write a love-love letter.

351
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,877
Mother is a spy,

352
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,021
a kind of spy that's not
ashamed of getting caught.

353
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,707
Once, a Rolling Stone issue in
which Charly GarcÃ­a bragged

354
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,636
about how some chick gave him head

355
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,354
under the piano during a concert.

356
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:14,145
"I threw it out," she says.

357
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:16,330
"I threw it out because it's perverse."

358
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,861
My aunt gives me the Rolling
Stone Mother threw out

359
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:21,099
and says, "Keep it safe."

360
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,237
Keep it safe.

361
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:27,313
Mother is a great censor.

362
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,872
Aunt is a great rescuer.

363
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,930
Mother got baptized in a swimming pool.

364
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,660
Hallelujah. Hallelujah, ma'am.

365
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,361
Aunt got baptized in a lake.

366
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:40,251
Mother never swears.

367
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,160
Aunt says fuck when she drives.

368
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,060
Fuck!

369
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,241
Mother is married to Father.

370
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:49,195
My aunt has had hundreds of boyfriends

371
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:50,819
but never gets married.

372
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:00,362
Mother gripes all the time but never gets sick.

373
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,275
Aunt hardly ever gripes and gets cancer.

374
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,852
I don't know who decided that cancer comes from

375
00:24:05,882 --> 00:24:10,231
bottling up a little pain
in your heart or wherever.

376
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:13,439
I don't know who decided
that Aunt had to get sick.

377
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:15,645
God?

378
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:34,906
There are two things in this
world that have no limits:

379
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:38,738
Aunt's love and Spy-Mom's spying.

380
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,408
There's one thing in this
world that has no answer:

381
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,117
what am I going to do without Aunt's love?

382
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:46,177
What will Spy-Mom do to me then?

383
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,466
I ran into your mom at the supermarket.

384
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:51,080
Creepy.
She looked at me with an evil face.

385
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,525
Slut, slut, slut.

386
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:54,887
Introduce me to your mom. I bet she's hot!

387
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:58,085
I'll huff and I'll puff,
and my dick in you I'll stuff.

388
00:24:58,115 --> 00:25:00,080
What's up between you and your
mommy, sweetheart?

389
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,143
Barbage, the tigress of the west.

390
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,504
Holy snatch, Tigress! What a difficult question.

391
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:07,581
I don't know.

392
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:08,792
So many shitty things

393
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:11,057
that I don't know how to say them in this blog.

394
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:12,642
Actually, what the hell.

395
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:15,247
I'm not sure if mother loves me, really.

396
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:18,045
Whatever, I don't know. It's too personal.

397
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,737
I once read in a Cosmopolitan about a trick

398
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:25,132
on how to suck dick with an
ice cube inside your mouth.

399
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:27,362
I never got it.
XOXO Young!

400
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:32,074
Will I ever meet you someday?
GOZPEL 1:5 A. & T. BY YOUNG & WILD

401
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,692
Now comes the interrogation.

402
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:43,464
I saw you on the street last Sunday.

403
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:45,183
Yeah?

404
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:46,636
I was in a car with my parents.

405
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,204
That's why I didn't say hi.

406
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:49,866
On your way to your sect?

407
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:52,800
On my way back. What were you doing?

408
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:55,372
I don't remember. Was I by myself?

409
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:57,366
Weren't you coming back from your sect?

410
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:58,989
I don't go to church.

411
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,784
But your uncle is the TV station's director.

412
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:09,041
What's the matter? Is that weird?

413
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:10,660
It's just- I don't understand

414
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,767
Why you'd work at that station
if you're not forced to.

415
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:15,045
I live on my own.

416
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:17,862
I pay for college, feed my cat.

417
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:19,462
What's its name?

418
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:20,573
Cat.

419
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,213
End of interrogation.

420
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:09,021
This reminds me of the Sailor Moon horniness.

421
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:11,741
Mr. R's Sunday school at age 11.

422
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:14,714
He says, "Write down on a piece of paper

423
00:27:14,755 --> 00:27:16,647
all you are holding before God."

424
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,722
I wrote down, "Sailor Moon.Â”

425
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,686
Shit, how I loved that Sailor Moon and her legs.

426
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:25,342
But Mr. R. didn't care about those legs.

427
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,441
He wanted little papers with idols on them.

428
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,043
Each kid handed in their piece of paper

429
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:30,484
with their idols on it.

430
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:33,366
He put them on the floor, lit them on fire,

431
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:34,674
and then said...

432
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:35,711
God comes first.

433
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:41,304
Sailor Moon

434
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:58,273
- Hello. - Hello.

435
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,902
- Are you from the TV station? - Yes.

436
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,447
- Hello. - Antonia.
Please, come in.

437
00:28:03,477 --> 00:28:05,003
- Hello. - Hello. Daniela.

438
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:06,160
Please, come in.

439
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:13,364
Could you pull this up underneath your shirt?

440
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:17,435
There it is.

441
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:23,790
And that?

442
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,688
In there, yes.

443
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:29,278
Thank you. Daniela, we're ready.

444
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:46,284
How did you find the Lord?

445
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:50,384
Well, I had a very good life, right?

446
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,603
A life filled with things:

447
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:57,596
money, a good car, a pretty girlfriend.

448
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:02,351
But I felt anguished.

449
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:06,179
I felt a weight on my chest.

450
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:08,812
One day I got preached to,

451
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:10,220
and I observed my life,

452
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,772
and I realized that it was
very full on the outside

453
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:15,225
but empty inside,

454
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:20,180
and I felt God had an important mission for me.

455
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:22,571
And how did you know?

456
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:23,892
God told me.

457
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,689
Speaking?

458
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:32,772
He put his message in my heart.

459
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:39,169
I reflected, and I decided to sell everything.

460
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:41,511
I got rid of everything.

461
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,150
And I talked to my girlfriend,

462
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,772
who I saw was a little reluctant,

463
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:48,940
to explain to her that if she didn't want

464
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,648
to share the message of Jesus Christ with me,

465
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,111
we had to break up

466
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:56,592
because my mission now was to preach

467
00:29:56,634 --> 00:29:59,647
in the name of Jesus Christ
throughout every nation.

468
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:02,941
And did your girlfriend convert?

469
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:04,311
No.

470
00:30:04,353 --> 00:30:06,273
No, she didn't accept the Lord.

471
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:09,186
Was there anger?

472
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,813
No.

473
00:30:15,853 --> 00:30:17,380
Actually, I was sad,

474
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,058
because I felt that she was missing out

475
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:22,890
on the gift of accepting Christ, no?

476
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:27,060
No, what I meant to ask you
was rather if she got angry

477
00:30:27,097 --> 00:30:30,217
because you were leaving
her for a life of preaching.

478
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:35,421
But that's not important.

479
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:40,996
We have to abandon our ego.

480
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,159
We have to crucify our ego

481
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:49,160
in order to accept Jesus Christ.

482
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:51,887
But you wanted to leave

483
00:30:51,922 --> 00:30:54,773
and break up with your girlfriend.

484
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:57,013
You wanted to follow Christ.

485
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:58,619
You weren't killing your ego.

486
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:01,548
You were doing what you wanted to do,

487
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:02,873
weren't you?

488
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:18,757
Well...

489
00:31:25,556 --> 00:31:26,804
Excuse me.

490
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:28,889
Is this the person who was
supposed to interview me?

491
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,331
- Yes, it's her. - Yes?

492
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:31,474
Yes.

493
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,894
I think he's pissed off.

494
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:45,473
Yes, Josue, hello. Look, yes, I'm here.

495
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:48,750
Your niece is here with a girl
that honestly doesn't know what to ask.

496
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,191
She's just asking nonsense.

497
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:53,734
I think that this isn't the way it works,

498
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:55,783
not like this.

499
00:31:55,826 --> 00:32:00,367
We're not going anywhere.

500
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:02,299
So I ask you to please talk to her,

501
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:04,445
I mean, first of all,
to make them stop wasting my time,

502
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:06,047
and talk to her because I guess

503
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:07,649
she can give you a better explanation.

504
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,243
Hold on for a second.

505
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,371
You're Antonia, right?

506
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:11,611
Yes.

507
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,810
- Yes, I'm coming. - Here she comes.

508
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:17,835
Excuse me. Well, I think so too.

509
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:20,390
That's why you should talk to her.

510
00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:22,664
Hello? Yes, Uncle.

511
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:31,221
Yes, we'll be right over.

512
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:38,290
We have hurt a brother in Christ,

513
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:39,521
and that is not righteous.

514
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:40,732
It's not righteous.

515
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:44,834
Daniela, you are not pleasing God.

516
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,184
I'm sorry, but I wanted to say-

517
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,258
Silence. I'm speaking.

518
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:53,038
Daniela,

519
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:56,141
you have shown an arrogant heart.

520
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:58,345
You know the Word.

521
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:01,591
You know that God loves those with
simple, humble hearts.

522
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:03,445
Look, JosuÃ©,

523
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,211
I gave Daniela the responsibility.

524
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:07,165
I couldn't go with them,
and she wasn't prepared.

525
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,940
I don't like thinking about Evangelical dicks.

526
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:11,970
I say "Evangelical dick," and I think:

527
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,795
one, limp dick,

528
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,870
two, premature dick.

529
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:18,298
But Jeezus is almighty.

530
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:19,686
Water into wine-

531
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,583
limp dick into hard dick.

532
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:26,826
Daniela and Antonia, please leave.

533
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,476
Sorry.

534
00:33:56,562 --> 00:34:00,488
I thought it was kind of funny.

535
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:01,648
Why?

536
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:04,786
I don't know.

537
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:10,830
And what happens if you get fired?

538
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,740
I get sent to Ecuador.

539
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:18,950
On vacation?

540
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:20,060
No.

541
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:22,122
On a missionary expedition.

542
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,501
How could you be such a brat?

543
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:32,809
Am I fired?

544
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:35,687
How could you tell him he hasn't left his ego?

545
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:38,558
You should have gotten fired.

546
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:40,480
You should have started off with that, TomÃ¡s.

547
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,912
How could you ask him

548
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:44,189
why he left his girlfriend for Jesus?

549
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:50,571
Hey, what are you laughing at?

550
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,012
Me?

551
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:54,269
You should have done something.
You were with her.

552
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:55,984
I'm sorry, but I get paid for taping,

553
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:57,164
and I taped.

554
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:58,709
Besides, I'm not one of those people

555
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:00,659
who believe in tiny lights in the sky.

556
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,282
They're not tiny lights.

557
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:04,923
Come on, don't get mad.

558
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,555
All right, I've got an idea.

559
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:08,169
Why don't we go see the princesses

560
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,263
so TomÃ¡s doesn't get even angrier?

561
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:15,037
You're so silly.

562
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:39,023
What's the name of the
sweatier guy with tattoos?

563
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:41,206
Cogwheel Jack.

564
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:42,616
And the other guy?

565
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:43,767
Coyote.

566
00:35:56,331 --> 00:35:59,440
If I had a boyfriend,
I would go out with Cogwheel Jack.

567
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,546
Why?

568
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,259
Do you like them tattooed and sweaty?

569
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:04,814
No. I like Cogwheel Jack.

570
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:07,032
Whatever.

571
00:36:07,062 --> 00:36:10,043
You know you still like
skinny, clean-cut guys like me.

572
00:36:10,073 --> 00:36:11,532
What an idiot!

573
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:32,255
A stands in front of T. T is shirtless.

574
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:34,320
T takes a look at A's legs,

575
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:36,039
A's beautiful legs.

576
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,527
T draws closer, tries to touch her.

577
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,081
A pushes him away, laughs.

578
00:36:41,113 --> 00:36:43,158
A attracts him, laughs.

579
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:44,575
I'm the public.

580
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,496
I don't laugh. I don't move.

581
00:36:46,527 --> 00:36:47,970
I want neither one to win.

582
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,784
I just want the almighty fuck to win.

583
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:53,795
"Fuck her," I say softly. "Go on, fuck her."

584
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:55,490
And A laughs.

585
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:57,835
She doesn't hear me while T knocks her down,

586
00:36:57,865 --> 00:36:59,881
while T spreads her beautiful legs

587
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,124
and says, "Stop laughing."

588
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,395
And I think,

589
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,356
"Okay, he's finally going to slip it into her."

590
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,662
But I can't think of them anymore.

591
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:10,641
I can only think about my body.

592
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:18,713
I can only think about my own body
that trembles, trembles, and trembles with filth

593
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:20,191
until it stops trembling.

594
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:01,862
GOZPEL 1:6 THE RIGHTEOUS PATH BY YOUNG & WILD

595
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:03,406
You had a crush on him as well.

596
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:05,008
No, I didn't. I just liked him.

597
00:38:05,038 --> 00:38:06,162
And he had a crush on you.

598
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:07,923
- No, no, we were just friends! - Oh, come on!

599
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,108
You were dating both of them for a while!

600
00:38:09,138 --> 00:38:10,309
No, I wasn't.

601
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,511
Yes, you were. Admit it.

602
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,241
No, we just gave each other little kisses.

603
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:15,479
- He even wrote you a letter. - When?

604
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:17,789
I remember it perfectly.
You were about to marry Rai.

605
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:19,518
And he went over to his house.

606
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,372
- I don't remember. - Yes.

607
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:23,907
Okay. Shut up.
He wrote you a letter. Yes, he did.

608
00:38:23,937 --> 00:38:26,482
And what did the letter say, "I love you"?

609
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:29,545
No, it said, "if you get
married, I'll kill you."

610
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,159
Just that. You were lucky.

611
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:35,592
And? Tell me.

612
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:39,406
He has an apostle's name.

613
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:41,265
John?

614
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:43,631
Peter?

615
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,678
Judas?

616
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:47,323
No, he was the one that said,

617
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:48,860
"I'll believe it when I see it."

618
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,797
TomÃ¡s? His name is TomÃ¡s?

619
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:53,353
Isabel?

620
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:55,745
They want to pray for you in the living room.

621
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:59,251
Yes, I'll be right over.

622
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:01,609
Danielita and I are talking about something.

623
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,435
Okay, don't get mysterious, all right?

624
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:04,992
We're talking about TomÃ¡s.

625
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,656
About who?

626
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:09,935
Who?

627
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,752
I'm going out with a boy from the TV station.

628
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:17,850
I will send you to Ecuador.

629
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,310
Oh, Mom.

630
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:24,176
What, do you want to sleep with him too?
Tere.

631
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:26,322
Stop it.

632
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:29,606
She was going to bring him
over so you could meet him.

633
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,879
Fuck.

634
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:37,326
I don't know why it pisses me
off so much to post about this.

635
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:38,671
Perhaps it's because I prefer

636
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:40,966
reading about sex than about love,

637
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:43,220
or perhaps it's because
the word "re-la-tion-ship"

638
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,101
seems so ugly to me.

639
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,698
I'm in a relationship.

640
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:50,355
And I'm kind of happy or almost happy.

641
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:51,836
And I don't know what else to say,

642
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:54,495
because we just do the same
things all nerdy couples do.

643
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,936
We go to the movies.

644
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:58,819
"But don't turn off your
cell phone," Mother says.

645
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:01,222
We eat ice cream,
and I give him my puppy-dog eyes

646
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:04,668
while licking it with my porno-tongue,
so that he'll think,

647
00:40:04,711 --> 00:40:06,180
"I'll forget about God,

648
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:07,949
"about virginity, and all that crap,

649
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:10,091
and I'm gonna fuck her speechless."

650
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:21,454
I'm not asking for the Moon

651
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:25,288
All I want is to love you

652
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,711
I want to be that wildness

653
00:40:27,743 --> 00:40:31,044
That vibrates deep inside of you

654
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm not asking for the Moon

655
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,919
I'm just asking for the moment

656
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:43,149
To rescue that skin and steal the star

657
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:48,780
That you and I see when we make love

658
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:53,430
And Cogwheel Jack is, like, everyone's favorite.

659
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,517
But you like him because he's gross.

660
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:56,734
No, he's not gross,

661
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:59,233
but the thing is that when he's fighting,

662
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:02,969
he sits down on his contender's face and wins.

663
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:04,125
What?

664
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:07,305
When did you see that?

665
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:09,313
Tere.

666
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:10,783
No, the thing is,

667
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:12,527
we go see them during our lunch break,

668
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:13,967
but it's just for a little while.

669
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:15,889
Yes, a very short while.

670
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:17,651
And then they go right back to the station

671
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,918
and don't stop anywhere else.

672
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:21,233
I don't know.

673
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,673
Even though we were all like
that, kind of happy,

674
00:41:23,703 --> 00:41:26,641
a certain fatality could be felt in the air.

675
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:29,215
And what has to happen on a fatal day happened,

676
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:30,529
as hard to believe as it may be.

677
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,303
Get down on the floor, or I'll kill you!

678
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:36,796
Let's go! Hand over all of your jewelry.

679
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:41,445
Place a protection barrier around us, Lord.

680
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:45,506
Place a barrier of angels around us, Lord.

681
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,088
TomÃ¡s asked the Lord

682
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:49,338
to place a barrier around us and blah.

683
00:41:49,368 --> 00:41:51,029
Father spoke in tongues,

684
00:41:51,188 --> 00:41:52,855
and it seems like the Lord listened

685
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,617
because the thugs passed right by our table

686
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,135
and never looked at us.

687
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:59,863
They didn't look at the
tables next to us either.

688
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,791
There are two possibilities.

689
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:04,364
Our prayer- I don't know if mine-

690
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:06,917
helped us save all the
sinners from the nearby tables

691
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:08,291
from the robbery.

692
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:14,241
Our prayer didn't do a
thing, because if God exists,

693
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:16,015
he's worrying about any old thing

694
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:17,898
except for that restaurant.

695
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,094
And the third option, the coolest one,

696
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,210
is that all the tables
around us were Evangelical,

697
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:27,222
and they were all praying
for a protection barrier.

698
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:30,833
Fourth option:

699
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:32,736
you gave your "Mr. Thug, don't steal from me,

700
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,498
and I'll suck your dick" face,

701
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:35,971
and then orgy with the thugs.

702
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:37,861
Fifth option: who cares?

703
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,271
The only thing that matters

704
00:42:39,301 --> 00:42:40,905
is that now Mom loves him so much-

705
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:43,179
as much as she can within
her mother possibilities-

706
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:46,180
that she lets me go out with him
and the internet is back.

707
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:48,735
You turned out so classy, Danilca.

708
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:52,628
I would have robbed you with this
hard gun I have between my legs.

709
00:42:52,658 --> 00:42:54,550
Dani, girl, what's going on with your stories?

710
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,729
I have to tell you something really cool.

711
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:59,984
Log on to MSN when you're less caged up.

712
00:43:00,025 --> 00:43:03,167
I came across this blog without wanting to,
and I wanted to say that perhaps

713
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,993
you haven't gotten to know the Lord's true love.

714
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:06,755
The important thing is that
you're going to know true love,

715
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,379
the one from down here.

716
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,627
This has nothing to do with this,

717
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,072
but I saw the best cat ever,

718
00:43:12,102 --> 00:43:14,070
and I had to tell you about it.

719
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:24,029
I was checking the internet
browser history the other day.

720
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,378
Mom was looking up your friends' names.

721
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:30,899
She also looked up teenage depression

722
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:34,193
and that boyfriend of yours
from three years ago, Diego.

723
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:39,932
She also looked up <i>Young & Wild.</i>

724
00:43:39,962 --> 00:43:41,364
Fuck, fuck!

725
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:42,489
What?

726
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:44,119
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

727
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:46,371
The dicks, the pussies-
it all comes out into the light!

728
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:49,396
Exposed fornicator, dead fornicator, fuck!

729
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:52,617
I'm joking.

730
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,720
"I'm joking."

731
00:43:55,915 --> 00:43:57,124
So what's the deal?

732
00:43:57,164 --> 00:43:58,672
Can she look up anything that I've seen?

733
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,913
Yeah, but you have to
clear the browsing history.

734
00:44:00,943 --> 00:44:02,191
How do you do that?

735
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:04,202
Press there.

736
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:06,547
"Clear history."

737
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:07,724
That's it.

738
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,140
That's easy.

739
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:11,989
She also looked up Pete Montana, look.

740
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,033
Pete Montana with no last name?

741
00:44:14,077 --> 00:44:15,968
Yes, just like that.

742
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,994
Pete is the name of my sister Julia's boyfriend.

743
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:23,582
Montana is the name of the state

744
00:44:23,623 --> 00:44:25,927
where my sister's boyfriend comes from.

745
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,590
Calling him Pete Montana

746
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,192
is like calling someone Helmut Germany

747
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:31,815
or Juanito Santiago.

748
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:36,213
The story of Pete Montana
can be told in three phrases.

749
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:40,208
Sister fornicated and
secretly married Pete Montana.

750
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:42,004
Mother could not forgive her.

751
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:46,524
Mother doesn't let me see my sister.

752
00:44:49,473 --> 00:44:51,201
My aunt lived at the beach

753
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:54,556
before she got cancer and came to live with us.

754
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:56,855
One day, she invites me to her house.

755
00:44:57,673 --> 00:44:59,680
My sister is at the beach.

756
00:44:59,723 --> 00:45:01,182
My aunt planned it.

757
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:07,368
We have an encounter that
feels like an illicit romance.

758
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:10,193
We go to the beach. We watch the sunset.

759
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:13,550
We walk by the shore. We eat beachy things.

760
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:15,790
We watch the sunset again.

761
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:17,082
While we're happy,

762
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:19,890
my aunt turns her cell phone
off for the whole weekend.

763
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,128
She doesn't want Mother to call her.

764
00:45:26,853 --> 00:45:28,745
Since these wheels are made
of rubber instead of silicone,

765
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:33,062
they've got a better grip on the street, get it?
Let's go check it out.

766
00:45:37,392 --> 00:45:39,975
The pastor's sermon...

767
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:41,942
We have gotten to know Jesus Christ-

768
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:45,774
not a cheap or hypocritical religion

769
00:45:45,816 --> 00:45:48,437
but Jesus Christ himself.

770
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:52,123
He's the one who has set us free.

771
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:53,474
And that's the bomb:

772
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:57,306
to live life to the fullest
in our lord Jesus Christ.

773
00:45:57,348 --> 00:45:59,863
And we've come here with problems,

774
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,849
with difficulties, with tests,

775
00:46:01,897 --> 00:46:04,109
with obstacles that may have
to do with drug addiction,

776
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,416
with alcoholism,

777
00:46:05,452 --> 00:46:08,145
but we have come here to know and to understand,

778
00:46:08,175 --> 00:46:11,343
for an obvious reason, that there is a God

779
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:14,039
that loves us and that accepts
us just the way we are.

780
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:16,113
But when we arrive to God,

781
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:17,882
there's an absolute change in our lives.

782
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:19,004
There's a change of heart.

783
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:21,136
There's a change of mind.

784
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,761
The truth is condensed in
the persona of Jesus Christ.

785
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,500
There is no other truth bigger than that.

786
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,005
Do you know why, brothers?

787
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,096
Because this truth for you
and for me has made us free.

788
00:46:32,135 --> 00:46:34,890
Could you give these tapes to Antonia?

789
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:41,577
A new love

790
00:46:41,617 --> 00:46:43,669
I never thought that I could find him

791
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:47,895
Who gave my life a reason to love

792
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:52,343
Jesus, my love and more than love will always be

793
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,796
Jesus, my love and more than love will always be

794
00:46:56,832 --> 00:47:03,073
Jesus, my love and more than love

795
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:10,346
Thank you.

796
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:14,359
He gets so Evangeloony sometimes.

797
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:17,651
You haven't slept with him yet?

798
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:20,278
He doesn't even want me to touch his dick.

799
00:47:23,227 --> 00:47:24,318
Has anyone ever told you,

800
00:47:24,348 --> 00:47:26,652
"No, I don't want to sleep with you"?

801
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,814
Once I was with a person that was a bit scared,

802
00:47:31,844 --> 00:47:33,188
but it passed.

803
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:34,978
Why scared?

804
00:47:36,201 --> 00:47:39,426
Maybe not scared but uptight.

805
00:47:39,468 --> 00:47:41,359
Did the person relax?

806
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,118
Yes.

807
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,323
How?

808
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,047
Hey, come to my birthday party.

809
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:50,200
Bring TomÃ¡s with you.

810
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,866
I'm not allowed to go out at night.

811
00:47:51,896 --> 00:47:55,093
But tell TomÃ¡s to ask your mom for permission.

812
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,942
Come see me.

813
00:47:57,983 --> 00:47:59,618
And now could you please let me work?

814
00:47:59,648 --> 00:48:05,437
Father, thou who art in heaven

815
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:10,221
Father, who art in my heart

816
00:48:13,646 --> 00:48:16,075
For years now, the idea of a threesome-

817
00:48:16,112 --> 00:48:18,100
a boyfriend and a little classmate

818
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,568
that had dark circles around her
eyes, huge tits,

819
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,354
and a face of eternal fuck.

820
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:24,796
I said to boyfriend, "I think about her."

821
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:26,461
Boyfriend calls one day and says,

822
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:28,344
"I dreamt about you and her."

823
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:30,273
Liar. No fucking way he dreamt of it.

824
00:48:30,303 --> 00:48:32,868
He probably jacked off very
consciously and thought,

825
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:35,975
"if I tell her I dreamt of
it, she won't get jealous."

826
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:39,106
But I was jealous, just a little,

827
00:48:39,144 --> 00:48:42,696
eclipsed by my once-again fiery twat.

828
00:48:53,302 --> 00:48:55,827
Once almost, at M's house,

829
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:57,661
but I got scared of I don't know what.

830
00:48:57,691 --> 00:49:00,696
But now at the TomÃ¡s-Antonia party, I think,

831
00:49:00,734 --> 00:49:02,836
"Third time's a charm."

832
00:49:02,881 --> 00:49:04,090
I think again,

833
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,990
"Fornication with him, with her, together,

834
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,008
is the perfect love that's not in the Bible."

835
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:09,948
Threesome, threesome, threesome.

836
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:15,550
GOZPEL 1:7 THE LITTLE STAIRCASES
OF SIN BY YOUNG & WILD

837
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,706
Come on, let's dance!

838
00:49:17,744 --> 00:49:20,211
I want to dance.
Let's dance.

839
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:21,701
Hey, I hate this music.

840
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:23,207
Then let's make out.

841
00:49:24,694 --> 00:49:27,027
Come on.

842
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:28,525
Hello.

843
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:29,847
Hello.

844
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:33,089
The tigress of the west.

845
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,818
Barbage.

846
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:37,086
This is my boyfriend, TomÃ¡s.

847
00:49:37,123 --> 00:49:38,333
- Hello. - Hello.

848
00:49:38,372 --> 00:49:39,419
Cute.

849
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:41,573
Daniela has talked a lot about you.

850
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,941
And you two, how do you know each other?

851
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:46,469
From around.

852
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,861
Come on, I want to dance.

853
00:49:55,895 --> 00:49:57,997
- Come on, no, no. - Come on.

854
00:50:15,658 --> 00:50:17,310
Dani.

855
00:50:17,356 --> 00:50:19,113
"Dani."

856
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,889
Dani.

857
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,161
Stop, stop, stop.

858
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:58,015
It's not funny.

859
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:01,613
How come David and Bathsheba fucked all day

860
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:04,034
and they weren't married?

861
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:05,739
That's the worst example.

862
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:07,283
Afterwards, they get punished by God.

863
00:51:07,313 --> 00:51:10,635
What a great punishment.

864
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:14,679
The Bible says that later on, he had 800 wives

865
00:51:14,712 --> 00:51:17,169
and he was fucking them all.

866
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:19,697
You heretic brat.

867
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:22,103
Well, at least they were all his wives.

868
00:51:22,143 --> 00:51:23,535
Let's get married then.

869
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:28,789
You're really drunk.

870
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:09,413
Hi.

871
00:52:09,456 --> 00:52:10,541
<i>Gated!</i>

872
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:12,967
Happy Birthday!

873
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:14,452
Thank you. How are you?

874
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,094
Barbage?

875
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:29,414
Will you come to the bathroom with me?

876
00:52:29,444 --> 00:52:31,998
Okay...

877
00:52:52,577 --> 00:52:55,745
What's the deal?

878
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,374
Damn it.

879
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:00,967
Well, whenever you feel like it.

880
00:53:02,443 --> 00:53:04,296
Here's your humble servant.

881
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,069
You left TomÃ¡s alone.

882
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,828
You forgot about me.

883
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:19,038
Even though I came here to fuck you and TomÃ¡s.

884
00:53:32,073 --> 00:53:33,215
Hello.

885
00:53:33,258 --> 00:53:34,660
Hello.

886
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:37,483
- Bye. - Bye.

887
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:38,603
Thank you.

888
00:53:41,362 --> 00:53:42,437
Bye.

889
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,455
They were kind of weird.

890
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:02,137
No, they were really normal.

891
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:06,382
Did you have a lot to drink?

892
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:07,592
Practically nothing.

893
00:54:07,629 --> 00:54:09,664
"Practically nothing."

894
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:11,122
Are you going to drive, Tere?

895
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:12,746
No, you drive.

896
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:24,769
Hug the person next to you

897
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:28,188
and tell them that they're beautiful.

898
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:29,983
You're beautiful.

899
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:31,296
You're beautiful.

900
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:37,991
You're beautiful.

901
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:43,302
You're beautiful.

902
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:44,693
If there's something that I hate,

903
00:54:44,723 --> 00:54:46,125
it's open letters-

904
00:54:46,164 --> 00:54:47,825
open letter to Chile,

905
00:54:47,862 --> 00:54:49,690
open letter to the baby who'll never be born,

906
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,387
open letter to the president,

907
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:53,598
open letter to I-dunno-what, I-dunno-who.

908
00:54:53,628 --> 00:54:56,662
But just like Paul, ex-Saul, I do what I hate...

909
00:54:58,105 --> 00:55:00,176
Open letter to TomÃ¡s.

910
00:55:00,206 --> 00:55:02,779
My spirit feels relieved.

911
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:04,833
Father looks at you with acceptance.

912
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:06,005
Aunt loves you.

913
00:55:06,048 --> 00:55:08,352
Mother trusts you.

914
00:55:08,386 --> 00:55:11,272
It's me and my raping power
that she doesn't trust.

915
00:55:11,302 --> 00:55:15,526
Tomas, Mother, as always, is right.

916
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:17,635
My spirit feels relieved,

917
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:20,169
but my poonani doesn't.

918
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:23,166
P.S.: I have a very intelligent idea-

919
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:25,174
to make a sex-themed video game.

920
00:55:25,204 --> 00:55:27,959
You earn ten points for conventional sex.

921
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,872
This is pussy-dick.

922
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,143
20 points for less conventional sex.

923
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:39,094
This is dick-ass.

924
00:55:39,138 --> 00:55:41,336
30 points for a threesome.

925
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,548
40 points for convincing a
virgin person to fornicate.

926
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:48,232
1,800 points- no, 1,800 million points

927
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:50,479
for convincing a man of God to fornicate.

928
00:55:50,509 --> 00:55:53,773
1,800 million points that I will never earn.

929
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,882
Boo. I've only got a few points.

930
00:55:55,922 --> 00:55:57,622
Fuck. Your boyfriend is a dumb-ass.

931
00:55:57,652 --> 00:55:59,860
I'd tell you, "Eat this Popsicle."

932
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:02,972
Hey, sister in flesh and blood,
I never post things on your blog.

933
00:56:03,002 --> 00:56:07,097
All this filthiness is making
me a little nervous. Ha, ha, ha.

934
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:08,737
I forgot that I was going to post this to say

935
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:10,980
that I have more points than
all of your followers combined

936
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,671
and added and multiplied.

937
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,914
And fucking the one who writes this
blog, how many points do I get for that?

938
00:56:15,944 --> 00:56:17,700
You lose points.

939
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:23,569
SAILOR HAS JUST SIGNED IN

940
00:56:25,183 --> 00:56:28,053
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: WHO ARE YOU'?

941
00:56:29,828 --> 00:56:32,199
SAILOR SAYS: SAILOR SATAN.

942
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,101
THE GIRL YOU LEFT OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM.

943
00:56:38,636 --> 00:56:40,172
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: HAHAHAHA!

944
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:45,546
SAILOR SAYS: HOW DID IT GO IN THE BATHROOM?

945
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:53,110
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: I DON'T KNOW. CONFUSION.

946
00:56:56,607 --> 00:56:58,978
SAILOR SAYS: FEAR OR CONFUSION?

947
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,496
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: IT DIDN'T SCARE ME.

948
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,411
SAILOR SAYS: AN EVANGELITEASE IS WHAT YOU ARE.

949
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:11,213
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: NO.

950
00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:13,410
SAILOR SAYS: YES!

951
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,387
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: NO. AND NO. AND NO.

952
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,926
They think I'm with TomÃ¡s.

953
00:59:20,802 --> 00:59:22,866
Do you want to go to Rene's Bar?

954
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:26,785
No.

955
00:59:47,646 --> 00:59:52,513
GOZPEL 1:8 BACON AND TOFU BY YOUNG & WILD

956
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:06,932
Okay, I'm off to pick up your brother
from the Christian Youth Club.

957
01:00:06,962 --> 01:00:09,602
So you stay here keeping Aunt Isabel company.

958
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:17,273
And don't go into your room all by yourselves.

959
01:00:17,308 --> 01:00:18,393
Bye.

960
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:16,653
Such a prude.

961
01:01:19,707 --> 01:01:20,984
Do you love me?

962
01:01:24,578 --> 01:01:26,047
I don't know.

963
01:01:30,406 --> 01:01:33,440
What do you mean, you don't know?

964
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,488
You're not even into me.

965
01:01:35,532 --> 01:01:37,730
What do you mean, I'm not into you?

966
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:47,807
The other day, I heard a man say

967
01:03:47,841 --> 01:03:51,614
he thought another guy liked both men and women.

968
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:55,167
He said this: "He likes both bacon and tofu."

969
01:03:56,715 --> 01:03:58,606
Nah. He totally looks like it.

970
01:03:58,636 --> 01:04:00,368
That guy likes to kick it with both feet.

971
01:04:00,398 --> 01:04:03,123
I wanted to ask him,
"And who would the bacon be?

972
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:04,404
Who would the tofu be?"

973
01:04:04,434 --> 01:04:06,162
But he got off the bus.

974
01:04:09,687 --> 01:04:11,098
Then I thought,

975
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:13,501
"I'll write the parable of the bacon and tofu."

976
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:15,058
Here it goes.

977
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,626
One: Fornication with her.

978
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,135
Two: Fornication with him.

979
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:30,112
Three: Fornication with her.

980
01:04:33,488 --> 01:04:35,379
Four: Fornication with him.

981
01:04:38,132 --> 01:04:40,619
Five: Fornication with her.

982
01:04:43,674 --> 01:04:45,853
Six: Fornication with him.

983
01:04:48,607 --> 01:04:51,161
Seven: Love with her.

984
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:56,540
Eight: Love with him.

985
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:02,511
Yes, I know. It's not a parable.

986
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:04,593
But I don't have much time, and unlike Jesus,

987
01:05:04,623 --> 01:05:06,870
I'll never be able to teach anything.

988
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:12,400
GOZPEL 1:9 IF I HAVE NO LOVE,
I AM NOTHING BY YOUNG & WILD

989
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,664
Everyone, pay attention. We're ready to roll.

990
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:20,827
Three, two, one.

991
01:05:20,864 --> 01:05:21,949
On air.

992
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,262
Hello, friends!

993
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:26,649
<i>Welcome to your show Rich in Christ.</i>

994
01:05:26,694 --> 01:05:30,332
Today we have two young contestants.

995
01:05:30,377 --> 01:05:32,238
Our first contestant, Leo,

996
01:05:32,268 --> 01:05:34,754
comes from the Baptist Church of Ã‘uÃ±oa.

997
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:37,381
Our second contestant, Vicente,

998
01:05:37,425 --> 01:05:39,509
comes from the Christian Missionary Church.

999
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:41,449
Boys, please say hello.

1000
01:05:42,614 --> 01:05:45,964
Let's go on to our first question.

1001
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:48,822
Complete the biblical verse:

1002
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:53,613
"For God so loved the world"...

1003
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:54,916
"That he gave his only begotten son,

1004
01:05:54,946 --> 01:05:56,646
"that whoever believes in him shall not perish

1005
01:05:56,676 --> 01:05:57,703
but have eternal life."

1006
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,241
"That he gave his only begotten son,

1007
01:05:59,271 --> 01:06:01,772
"that whoever believes in him shall not perish

1008
01:06:01,802 --> 01:06:03,357
but have eternal life."

1009
01:06:03,403 --> 01:06:04,488
l won.

1010
01:06:04,524 --> 01:06:07,116
Excellent, Leo! Very good!

1011
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:09,608
So let's go on to the second question.

1012
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,350
It reads as follows. Attention...

1013
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:15,308
Today there's no parable
or metaphor or comparison

1014
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,467
or biblical reinterpretation or anything,

1015
01:06:17,497 --> 01:06:19,612
'cause I'm feeling like a
fucking cock-dick-prick.

1016
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,760
Sorry, sorry.

1017
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:24,755
Seeing bacon and tofu every day.

1018
01:06:25,057 --> 01:06:26,401
I'm confused,

1019
01:06:26,435 --> 01:06:29,670
and I don't know if I want to
write, but I do write.

1020
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,185
I don't know why I write,

1021
01:06:31,215 --> 01:06:34,143
and maybe it's better if I talk about the Bible.

1022
01:06:36,627 --> 01:06:38,840
Once, in Corinthians, Paul said,

1023
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,922
"if I have not love, l am nothing."

1024
01:06:40,952 --> 01:06:42,325
l am nothing.

1025
01:06:42,361 --> 01:06:43,613
"If I do not have love,

1026
01:06:43,643 --> 01:06:47,089
I become as sounding brass
or a tinkling cymbal."

1027
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:48,507
Hey, come on.

1028
01:07:01,709 --> 01:07:04,877
And I want to ask Paul, God, Mother,

1029
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:07,120
some blogger, someone,

1030
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:09,430
what happens if I have too much love?

1031
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:12,627
What happens if I like two people?
If I love two?

1032
01:07:12,664 --> 01:07:16,702
If I like doing dirty things with both?
Is it better than having no love at all?

1033
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,612
What the fuck happens,
Paul, Mother, God, blogger?

1034
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:25,821
Do I become nothing? Am I less than nothing?

1035
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:37,328
GOZPEL 1:10 BUH-BYE OLD SELF BY YOUNG & WILD

1036
01:07:39,315 --> 01:07:40,407
No, come on, seriously.

1037
01:07:40,437 --> 01:07:42,894
Let's have a real conversation now.

1038
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,499
Let's do something.

1039
01:07:44,537 --> 01:07:46,582
You tell me everything you like

1040
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:50,968
and everything you want, and then I'll tell you.

1041
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:55,961
I like waking up sick on Sundays...

1042
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:03,975
Being afraid of dachshunds,

1043
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:07,325
chatting online until my eyes burn at night...

1044
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:10,352
We talked about pretty
things, and there were boats

1045
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:13,680
and sun, a lake, and even a parrot,

1046
01:08:13,718 --> 01:08:15,867
and all we needed was that perfect song.

1047
01:08:15,897 --> 01:08:18,642
Cha, na, na

1048
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:21,141
Like when soap operas end.

1049
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,052
But the difference was that nothing was ending.

1050
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:25,979
Drenched on your back

1051
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,910
I feel happy

1052
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:29,439
We don't get up anymore

1053
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,178
And I hold you against my chest

1054
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,936
With all my soul

1055
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,630
I could die tomorrow

1056
01:08:34,668 --> 01:08:36,357
I could die stuck here

1057
01:08:36,397 --> 01:08:39,430
Completely drugged

1058
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:45,337
Oh, friend of mine

1059
01:08:49,082 --> 01:08:55,323
I know we're never going to let

1060
01:08:55,777 --> 01:09:00,567
I know we're never going to let

1061
01:09:00,614 --> 01:09:04,675
This love go away from us

1062
01:09:06,828 --> 01:09:08,105
Leave.

1063
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:12,357
I don't want to leave.

1064
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:13,749
You said that you had to go.

1065
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:15,056
Go.

1066
01:09:16,822 --> 01:09:19,510
But not like this.

1067
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:22,396
Then we can do it like we always do.

1068
01:09:22,428 --> 01:09:25,233
You leave because you have 800 missed calls
from your mother,

1069
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,640
because you have to be with TomÃ¡s.

1070
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:30,054
I say, "Good-bye. See you at the station."

1071
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:34,183
You kiss me on the mouth, and we chat online,

1072
01:09:34,216 --> 01:09:35,947
and then we laugh at the station,

1073
01:09:35,977 --> 01:09:38,147
and everything is super cool.

1074
01:09:38,188 --> 01:09:40,713
What do you think?

1075
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,150
That I want it to be like this forever?

1076
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:11,592
Mother says that sinning is a matter of steps.

1077
01:10:11,629 --> 01:10:12,906
She says,

1078
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:16,000
"When you open the door for the
enemy, he enters."

1079
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:18,400
I could say that I've
climbed up the steps of sin;

1080
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:22,345
although it'd be more accurate to say down-
considering hell is not above-

1081
01:10:22,393 --> 01:10:23,958
the stairsteps of sin.

1082
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:25,617
At first I said

1083
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,185
I'd never fuck before marriage.

1084
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:29,634
Okay, I never said that.

1085
01:10:29,664 --> 01:10:32,965
But I did say I'd never cheat.

1086
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,272
While cheating,

1087
01:10:34,309 --> 01:10:35,880
I made an infinite list of et ceteras,

1088
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:39,232
but I always knew when I
went down step after step.

1089
01:10:39,274 --> 01:10:40,781
And the problem is the following:

1090
01:10:40,811 --> 01:10:43,440
I'd never said I wouldn't
be with two people at once.

1091
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:46,803
I never knew that suddenly
it wouldn't be step after step anymore

1092
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,683
but more like falling down the stairs.
And now I say,

1093
01:10:49,716 --> 01:10:53,710
God, I want to walk down a
clean, righteous path.

1094
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:55,577
And that's it. Righteous.

1095
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:56,724
Right?

1096
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:21,186
Wasn't TomÃ¡s dropping you off today?

1097
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,888
What's wrong with you?

1098
01:11:30,014 --> 01:11:31,770
Daniela, what did you do?

1099
01:11:35,138 --> 01:11:36,895
I want to get baptized.

1100
01:11:51,268 --> 01:11:52,824
Go to my house.

1101
01:11:52,871 --> 01:11:54,080
To the beach?

1102
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,329
Yes.

1103
01:11:55,369 --> 01:11:57,279
Get baptized where I did.

1104
01:12:03,022 --> 01:12:04,417
Let's all go.

1105
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:05,560
Yes.

1106
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:12,712
Awesome.

1107
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:14,257
I'll be cold if I wear that.

1108
01:12:14,287 --> 01:12:15,468
Who cares?

1109
01:12:15,504 --> 01:12:17,363
Hey, you have to get a
less pornographic T-shirt.

1110
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:19,093
But all white T-shirts are pornographic.

1111
01:12:19,123 --> 01:12:20,467
But yours even more,

1112
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:23,033
because it's made out of
that old fabric, you know?

1113
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:24,538
You can get a white one anywhere.

1114
01:12:24,568 --> 01:12:28,372
I can get it for you if you want.
Why do you need a white T-shirt?

1115
01:12:28,412 --> 01:12:29,689
I've got several.

1116
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:31,042
Because I'm getting baptized.

1117
01:12:31,072 --> 01:12:34,076
You have to wear a white T-shirt for baptism.

1118
01:12:34,115 --> 01:12:35,846
See, Anto can lend you one. Cool.

1119
01:12:35,876 --> 01:12:37,608
Dani, you're getting baptized?

1120
01:12:37,638 --> 01:12:38,877
Yes.

1121
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,648
That's great. Congratulations.

1122
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:55,893
SAILOR SAYS: BAPTISM?

1123
01:12:55,928 --> 01:12:59,864
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: BAPTISM.

1124
01:12:59,901 --> 01:13:03,827
SAILOR SAYS: IS YOUR MOM MAKING YOU?

1125
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:06,109
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: NO.

1126
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:12,091
Dani, Dani.

1127
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,709
Could you come see this
thing we're editing, please?

1128
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,332
Sure. I'll be right over.

1129
01:13:18,704 --> 01:13:20,777
YOUNG&WILD SAYS: LET'S TALK LATER.

1130
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:26,458
What's up?

1131
01:13:26,488 --> 01:13:29,809
How long do you think this should be?

1132
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:32,011
He wants to cut it here, you see...

1133
01:13:34,835 --> 01:13:37,485
Are you willing to let your ego die?

1134
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:42,842
Evangelical baptism isn't like
some bullshit Catholic baptism.

1135
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:46,018
Evangelic baptism is done when you're older,

1136
01:13:46,059 --> 01:13:48,400
conscious that you want to follow Jeezus

1137
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:50,734
and leave your old self in the toilet.

1138
01:14:04,991 --> 01:14:08,380
Evangelic baptism takes place outdoors.

1139
01:14:08,418 --> 01:14:10,374
I would do it in a tropical swimming pool.

1140
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:14,120
But the Lord will always be there with you,

1141
01:14:14,152 --> 01:14:15,525
because he tells us...

1142
01:14:15,562 --> 01:14:17,293
I only thought about
getting baptized once before

1143
01:14:17,323 --> 01:14:19,522
in school, when I was 14,

1144
01:14:19,566 --> 01:14:22,258
when I got close to Jeezus
like everyone else did.

1145
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:23,815
I am nothing without you.

1146
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:26,248
I am nothing without you.

1147
01:14:27,542 --> 01:14:31,190
Those of you who feel that
you have lost the way,

1148
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:33,260
who wish to amend their ways,

1149
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:36,572
tell him, "Take me, Lord."

1150
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:38,681
Take me, Lord.

1151
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:43,267
Those of you who are rebels at heart,

1152
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:47,420
tell Jesus, "Lord, take me."

1153
01:14:47,466 --> 01:14:50,816
I did Daniel's fast- legumes and vegetables.

1154
01:14:52,398 --> 01:14:55,533
And I really did it,
because I felt close to God,

1155
01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:57,905
and I was proto-anorexic.

1156
01:14:57,962 --> 01:14:59,960
I remember that we went to the hill to pray,

1157
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,242
and Ms. Cecilia told me

1158
01:15:01,272 --> 01:15:03,423
that my heart was getting pretty.

1159
01:15:03,453 --> 01:15:05,846
Lord, move her heart.

1160
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,247
Lord, touch Daniela,

1161
01:15:08,543 --> 01:15:10,453
move her heart.

1162
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,374
Shamba, ramba, rimba, ramba

1163
01:15:14,408 --> 01:15:17,470
Shamba, ramba, rimba

1164
01:15:17,515 --> 01:15:19,080
Shamba, ramba

1165
01:15:19,117 --> 01:15:22,438
Lord, illuminate our youth,

1166
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,199
all these children.

1167
01:15:24,242 --> 01:15:25,490
Shamba, ramba...

1168
01:15:25,524 --> 01:15:27,416
And time passed, and time passed,

1169
01:15:27,446 --> 01:15:29,001
and I got lost.

1170
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:30,765
And my heart wasn't pretty.

1171
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:33,429
And today, that I'm more lost than ever,

1172
01:15:33,468 --> 01:15:35,061
I want to try it again.

1173
01:15:36,543 --> 01:15:37,793
Pastor Uncle asks me...

1174
01:15:37,823 --> 01:15:41,654
Are you willing to give up your old self?

1175
01:15:43,718 --> 01:15:46,915
Are you willing to let your ego die?

1176
01:15:48,843 --> 01:15:52,520
Do you know what it means to let your ego die?

1177
01:15:55,762 --> 01:15:57,494
And I think, "I don't know. I don't know."

1178
01:15:57,524 --> 01:15:59,095
But in the end, I say to Pastor Uncle...

1179
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:02,120
Placing Christ first?

1180
01:16:02,168 --> 01:16:05,202
Placing Christ before
anything that I'd like to do.

1181
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,075
And I think, "I love bacon. I love tofu.

1182
01:16:11,105 --> 01:16:12,353
"Maybe I love Jeezus.

1183
01:16:12,387 --> 01:16:14,054
"I love bacon. I love tofu.

1184
01:16:14,084 --> 01:16:15,841
I want to be clean, clean."

1185
01:16:15,878 --> 01:16:17,568
You went crazy.

1186
01:16:17,608 --> 01:16:20,173
Hey, I was an Evangelical
and I got baptized and everything,

1187
01:16:20,203 --> 01:16:23,202
and all I remember is that I was freezing,
and I caught a cold.

1188
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:25,458
Fuck, girl, I'm finding out about shit

1189
01:16:25,488 --> 01:16:28,359
that you should be telling me to my face.

1190
01:16:28,403 --> 01:16:31,638
Girl, I can understand you sleeping with a lady.

1191
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:34,043
I can understand you sleeping with a man.

1192
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:36,924
But I can't understand you getting baptized.

1193
01:16:36,956 --> 01:16:40,767
I would even baptize myself in
a fucking ice-cold lake for you.

1194
01:16:40,799 --> 01:16:43,589
Girls, please hurry up.
Teresa is already downstairs.

1195
01:16:43,619 --> 01:16:45,510
- Uncle. - What?

1196
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:47,480
It's that... I'm not going.

1197
01:16:47,526 --> 01:16:49,212
Why not?

1198
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:50,860
Because I have things to do.

1199
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:52,033
As you wish.

1200
01:16:55,823 --> 01:16:56,898
What's going on?

1201
01:16:56,944 --> 01:16:58,442
What?

1202
01:16:58,482 --> 01:17:01,132
What do you mean, you're not going?

1203
01:17:01,172 --> 01:17:04,182
What do you want me to do there?
I'm not a part of that.

1204
01:17:04,215 --> 01:17:05,646
Who cares?

1205
01:17:08,604 --> 01:17:12,396
Okay, and am I supposed to clap
when you come out of the water?

1206
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,035
Come.

1207
01:17:16,868 --> 01:17:18,452
I want you to be with me.

1208
01:17:20,648 --> 01:17:22,203
It's that...

1209
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:25,485
I like you more than a lot.

1210
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:26,826
I want-

1211
01:17:26,856 --> 01:17:28,546
I need you to be there.

1212
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,051
I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.

1213
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:38,742
70 times 7, I love you.

1214
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,428
Is that a phrase from your sect?

1215
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:44,350
Yes. 70 times 7 means infinity.

1216
01:17:47,715 --> 01:17:48,829
Where?

1217
01:17:48,868 --> 01:17:50,184
In the twee Bible?

1218
01:18:04,469 --> 01:18:05,582
I'm ready.

1219
01:18:08,661 --> 01:18:12,626
GOZPEL 1:11 NOW WE SEE THROUGH A
GLASS, DARKLY BY YOUNG & WILD

1220
01:18:13,309 --> 01:18:15,546
Who gave you this toy?

1221
01:18:15,584 --> 01:18:16,996
Grandma and Grandpa, I think.

1222
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,302
Yeah, right?

1223
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:29,387
I love this one. Look.

1224
01:18:29,422 --> 01:18:30,853
No, Aunt.

1225
01:18:30,896 --> 01:18:32,422
This is for her birthday.

1226
01:18:32,465 --> 01:18:34,325
Danielita.

1227
01:18:34,355 --> 01:18:36,246
Don't look at it.

1228
01:18:36,277 --> 01:18:38,393
This is when she was turning eight, and her dad-

1229
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:39,988
Let me see!

1230
01:18:40,025 --> 01:18:44,402
This little princess crown
was a gift from her dad.

1231
01:18:44,446 --> 01:18:47,074
She thought that she was
the prettiest at the party

1232
01:18:47,104 --> 01:18:48,515
until Pamela showed up,

1233
01:18:48,546 --> 01:18:52,067
and she thought that she was prettier than her,
so she got mad.

1234
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:55,134
She went to sit down over
here next to the chips.

1235
01:18:57,462 --> 01:19:00,727
That's where Rai took this picture.

1236
01:19:00,762 --> 01:19:03,287
- Cute, right? - Yes.

1237
01:19:03,324 --> 01:19:04,400
Daniela?

1238
01:19:04,446 --> 01:19:06,273
Let's go for a walk on the beach?

1239
01:19:06,303 --> 01:19:08,214
Okay. Let's go?

1240
01:19:08,258 --> 01:19:09,371
Let's go.

1241
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:30,500
Hey, so do you still think you
are the prettiest in the world?

1242
01:19:30,584 --> 01:19:32,955
Of course.

1243
01:19:32,987 --> 01:19:35,320
That's because you hadn't met me yet.

1244
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,932
And then you write that you sleep with me,

1245
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,690
and everyone reads about it!

1246
01:20:05,723 --> 01:20:06,815
Don't tell me to calm down!

1247
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:09,216
Don't pretend to be my friend, bitch!

1248
01:20:09,248 --> 01:20:11,801
You're sleeping with her!

1249
01:21:04,888 --> 01:21:06,165
What's wrong?

1250
01:21:10,109 --> 01:21:11,222
Nothing.

1251
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:13,945
And TomÃ¡s?

1252
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:17,561
We had a fight.

1253
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:20,707
Why?

1254
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:26,020
Because I was being kind of mean today.

1255
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:28,269
And why were you being mean?

1256
01:21:28,304 --> 01:21:32,134
Because I didn't get to fin-

1257
01:21:39,932 --> 01:21:41,429
Let go of me.

1258
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:44,122
When Isabel arrived at our house

1259
01:22:44,157 --> 01:22:48,630
less than a year ago,

1260
01:22:48,674 --> 01:22:51,064
she said, "Tere, I'm sick."

1261
01:22:53,254 --> 01:22:57,094
I thought about what Paul said
in Epistle to the Corinthians.

1262
01:22:59,244 --> 01:23:01,369
He said,

1263
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:07,639
"For now we see through a glass, darkly."

1264
01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:16,740
Now that my sister, Isabel

1265
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:19,055
is dead...

1266
01:23:23,759 --> 01:23:25,516
I think of Paul once more.

1267
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,553
It may be that I don't...

1268
01:23:36,348 --> 01:23:40,226
It may be that I now see things darkly.

1269
01:23:42,466 --> 01:23:46,114
It may be that I don't understand.

1270
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:47,581
And I don't.

1271
01:23:52,325 --> 01:23:57,116
But I also think about what Paul said,

1272
01:23:57,297 --> 01:24:00,014
that death in Christ is a gain.

1273
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,432
What do we gain

1274
01:24:14,531 --> 01:24:15,943
with the death of all things?

1275
01:24:15,973 --> 01:24:17,566
I don't know.

1276
01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:22,146
I still don't know.

1277
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:33,659
Now I'd like for us to sing a song

1278
01:24:33,814 --> 01:24:35,725
that my sister loved so much.

1279
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:46,857
I

1280
01:24:46,892 --> 01:24:51,010
will be reborn today in Jesus

1281
01:24:51,056 --> 01:24:52,784
Let's go.

1282
01:24:52,818 --> 01:24:56,168
You shall see me return

1283
01:24:56,214 --> 01:25:02,454
Towards the divine light I know I shall depart

1284
01:25:02,588 --> 01:25:05,266
My soul is enlightened

1285
01:25:05,311 --> 01:25:08,507
I know I'll make it there

1286
01:25:08,546 --> 01:25:13,020
I know I'll make it there

1287
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:21,609
Today, I know that I'll be reborn

1288
01:25:21,647 --> 01:25:27,887
And in his eyes, you shall see me return

1289
01:25:28,053 --> 01:25:29,964
Today, I know...

1290
01:25:30,008 --> 01:25:34,578
GOZPEL 1:12 POSTSCRIPT BY YOUNG & WILD

1291
01:25:57,107 --> 01:25:59,410
Paul said in Corinthians,

1292
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,435
"When I was a child, I understood as a child.

1293
01:26:02,553 --> 01:26:06,596
I spoke as a child. I thought as a child."

1294
01:26:06,626 --> 01:26:09,112
Blah, blah, blah as a child.

1295
01:26:09,344 --> 01:26:12,554
"But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."

1296
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,616
I say it in nowhere:

1297
01:26:14,646 --> 01:26:17,305
when I was a child, I thought like a child.

1298
01:26:17,431 --> 01:26:19,441
I understood as a child.

1299
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:21,317
Now that I'm a non-child,

1300
01:26:21,347 --> 01:26:23,440
I haven't put anything away, and I don't care

1301
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,163
because I don't know if I believe in happiness

1302
01:26:26,193 --> 01:26:27,662
or in peace

1303
01:26:27,698 --> 01:26:29,109
or in maturi-tease
